# Project Title

## Description

This project involves creating a full-stack web application based on a Figma design. The process includes front-end development, component creation, backend setup using MongoDB and Node.js, and deployment on AWS EC2. 

Due to ongoing end-semester exams, some tasks are pending, but the project will be completed within 2 days.

## Project Flow

### 1. Figma Design
- Created an initial design based on the provided frontend requirements using Figma.
- Designed multiple screens and UI components to visualize the application's user interface.

### 2. Frontend Development
- Converted the Figma design into functional components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React if applicable).
- Built responsive UI components for different sections of the application.

### 3. Backend Development
- Developed the backend system using Node.js.
- Integrated MongoDB as the database for managing data storage and retrieval.
- Created RESTful APIs for handling various operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and user authentication if needed.

### 4. Deployment
- Deployed the complete application on AWS EC2 using Ubuntu (or any chosen server environment).
- Set up the environment and installed necessary dependencies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and other related packages.

### 5. Pending Tasks
Due to ongoing exams, some tasks are yet to be completed:
- Final touch-ups on the UI and testing of individual components.
- Full backend integration and testing.
- Final deployment and production environment setup.

### 6. Upcoming Plans
- The project will be completed within the next two days, with all remaining tasks being finished as soon as exams are over.
